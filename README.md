#  Blinkit Data Analysis Project

#  Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Blinkit (formerly Grofers) sales and delivery data to uncover key insights into product performance, customer preferences, and revenue trends.
Using Python and its popular data analytics libraries, we explore, clean, and visualize the dataset to make data-driven business decisions.

#  Objective

The main goals of this project are:

To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Blinkit’s dataset.

To identify trends in sales, ratings, and product categories.

To visualize performance metrics and derive insights for better decision-making.

# Key Steps in Analysis

1. Data Loading & Inspection – Import dataset and check for missing values, duplicates, and data types.


2. Data Cleaning – Handle missing values using fillna() and format corrections.


3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) –

Sales by category, item type, and region.

Relationship between item weight, visibility, and sales.

Outlet performance comparison.

4. Visualization –

Bar charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
